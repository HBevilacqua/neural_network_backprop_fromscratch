# Neural network backpropagation from scratch in Python

The initial code is provided by the amazing tutorial "*How to Implement the Backpropagation Algorithm From Scratch In Python*" by Jason Brownlee.<br>
https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-backpropagation-algorithm-scratch-python/

I tried to understand mechanisms in this code before starting projects using machine learning libraries.
